                    Originally, the personality section of this persona was based off the Myers Briggs personality test. According to the Myers Briggs, there are 16 potential user personality types. Our template integrates questions from this online personality test example into a series of sliding bar graphics. If youre confused as to what the sliders mean, check out the Myers Briggs basics article.

                    I list out a jumble of words and draw tiny sketches related to what Im working on (and find the parallels later). Personally, I prefer paper with a grid so I can convey things responsively. Most of the time perfection isnt an issue and the sketches are just for me.
